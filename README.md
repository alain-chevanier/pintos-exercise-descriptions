This project includes infraestructure to run the code from a docker image and every exercise provide a script to actually execute the tests to be graded in that specific exercise and the previous tests within the same project.

This project only has the code base, the dockerimage and some branches with the solutions, if you want to see the exercise descriptions you may visit the [this repo](https://github.com/alain-chevanier/pintos-exercise-descriptions).

## Software Dependencies

File are created using `Tex` + `Lyx`, only those are necessary to edit the files and fenerate the PDFs.
